I realized that the last note I sent on this topic was unimpressive so sat down to make something better as there are several people who have enquired since.

Previously we had a link with some information as follows:

So you want to be a security professional?

Careers in Information Security are challenging and rewarding. Threats posed by cyber criminals are not going away and there is a forecasted global shortage of 3.5 million cybersecurity professionals by 2021. Security professionals come from all walks of life. Not every job requires significant technical knowledge. In Canada there is no 4 year cybersecurity degree though there are diplomas and masters programs. Approximately half of security professionals will have a computer science or engineering degree. Others spent a lot of time on the helpdesk or other IT roles. Still others have little or no IT experience. There are a variety of challenges well suited for a variety of backgrounds. Careers in security are often not suggested by academic advisors and counsellors because there is no defined path to become a security professional.

What is a Security Professional?

A strategic thinker able to interpret the changing threat landscape, understand the implications of changing technology, and enable the business to achieve it’s goals.
